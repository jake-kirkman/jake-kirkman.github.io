An insurance client of ours at the time was planning on implementing Income Protection into the range of policies they offered. This project was overseen by myself and two other developers to build the Salesforce side of the changes, where an external third party company developed the REST APIs that we used to connect to other various internal systems of the clients. This was an Agile Scrum project with tri-weekly sprints.

My role in this project was primarily:
- Communicate clearly with the product owner to ascertain their needs and desires and then formulate user stories
- Design and iterate on various Wireframes detailing the plan of action
- Develop Flows, Workflows, Process Builders, Apex Triggers, LWCs and Visualforce pages to build the tool they envisioned
- Present the work at the sprint review to the 20+ users working for our client
- Iterate on any feedback we received 
- Help QA with any issues that were raised and resolve them in a timely manner
