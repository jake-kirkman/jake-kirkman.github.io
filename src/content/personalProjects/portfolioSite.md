This is what you're currently viewing, being [jake-kirkman.github.io](jake-kirkman.github.io) which I created as a way to showcase my previous projects and as a way to practice my skills with React.

This is built using React, Bootstrap CSS and Typescript, hosted on github pages.

Since it's primary purpose was to display my previous projects, I knew that I had to:
1. Make it as easy as possible to add new projects to this site, and as such I opted to have a series of `Markdown` files for the main body text of each page/item, with a JSON metadata alongside it to give it a title and tags. I chose markdown since it allows me to do basic lists, tables and headers without having to worry about HTML
2. Make it easy for the user viewing the site to read my projects, this meant implementing search and filtering on each list page
