## Personal Statement

I strive to be someone who can be proud of what they do, and develop things that benefit others greatly. I am personally a very curious individual and I love to delve deep into documentation and specifications to figure out how things work and how to make the best use of it.

## What I'm looking for

I'm currently a senior developer at Greengage Global Holding working primarily with Salesforce, however I'm looking to branch out to other technologies such as React, Flutter, React Native and similar frameworks

## About Me

Outside of working hours I generally spend my time going out on walks, creating mods for various PC games, watching and doing various tech repairs, and creating (and learning) new technologies.

## Work History

I finished Sixth Form in 2019 and joined Silver Lined Solutions in January 2020 as a Junior Developer, and have since worked with many different clients, developers and on a wide range of different projects.

I graduated from being the new Junior Developer after only 6 months, and was given the responsibility of being the lead developer for Greengage who was a client at the time. Eventually becoming a Senior Developer in May 2023.

I speak about the projects I have done whilst at Silver Lined Solutions/Greengage within the [Professional Projects](/professional-projects) page, so feel free to have a look there.
