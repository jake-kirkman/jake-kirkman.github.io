## Personal Statement

I am a dedicated developer with a passion for creating solutions that make a meaningful impact on others. My work is driven by a relentless curiosity, which leads me to delve deep into documentation and specifications to understand how things work and how to optimize my code for the benefit of all.

My commitment is to develop software that I can be proud of, focusing on usability and functionality. I thrive on the satisfaction of solving complex problems and crafting elegant solutions. This drive keeps me pushing my boundaries and learning new things.

## What I'm looking for

With nearly five and a half years of professional experience in Salesforce development at Bionic/Greengage/Silver Lined Solutions, I'm now seeking to further this experience and continue to expand my knowledge of Salesforce and push myself, as there is nothing I enjoy more than being presented with a challenge.

I'd also like to diversify into other areas I've explored, such as Web Development using React or into Mobile Development using Flutter/React Native, and contribute my expertise to innovative projects.

## About Me

Outside of working hours I generally spend my time going out on walks, creating mods for various PC games, watching and doing various tech repairs, and creating (and learning) new technologies.

## Work History

I am currently a Senior Salesforce Developer for Bionic working in an Agile Scrum environment alongside a team of 4 Developers and 5 Admins. I often lead a bi-weekly technical demos time to align my team with other Salesforce experts in the business, and frequently mentor both Developers and Admins on a day-to-day basis. 

I joined Bionic in February 2024 as a mid-level Salesforce developer, and was promoted to Senior Salesforce Developer after only 11 months in January 2025. During my time here, I've worked on many vital projects for the company, such as:
- Rebuilding the core sales process within Salesforce which was previously built in Aura Components, to use the latest features from Flows, Lightning Web Components and Apex
- Rolling out Amazon Connect for all 300+ sales agents
- Migrating the SpringCM solution to the newer DocuSign CLM which is a core process to completing every sale at Bionic
- I was also the lead developer on implementing OwnBackup in Salesforce for Bionic's backup and recovery process 

Before that, I started at Silver Lined Solutions - a Salesforce Consultancy - and joined as a Junior developer back in the start of 2020 working as a Salesforce Consultant, which meant speaking with clients and fulfilling their requests for their Salesforce org (ranging from everything simple like creating fields and validation rules to more complex things like bespoke LWCs and automations). After just 6 months I was offered the opportunity to be the lead developer for DAG (who is now known as Greengage) to build the foundations for their Salesforce org which is what I did for three and a half years - constructing everything from a deal instalment system, to a bespoke onboarding process, and integrations with tools like GBG, ComplyAdvantage, Wix and BVD - with smaller projects arising here and there for other clients of ours over the years.
