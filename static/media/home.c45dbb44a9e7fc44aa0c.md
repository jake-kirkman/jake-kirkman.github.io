## Personal Statement

I am a dedicated developer with a passion for creating solutions that make a meaningful impact on others. My work is driven by a relentless curiosity, which leads me to delve deep into documentation and specifications to understand how things work and how to optimize my code for the benefit of all.

My commitment is to develop software that I can be proud of, focusing on usability and functionality. I thrive on the satisfaction of solving complex problems and crafting elegant solutions. This drive keeps me pushing my boundaries and learning new things.

## What I'm looking for

With nearly four years of professional experience in Salesforce development at Greengage/Silver Lined Solutions, I'm now seeking to further this experience or diversify into other areas I've explored, such as Web Development using React or into Mobile Development using Flutter/React Native, and contribute my expertise to innovative projects

## About Me

Outside of working hours I generally spend my time going out on walks, creating mods for various PC games, watching and doing various tech repairs, and creating (and learning) new technologies.

## Work History

I am currently a Senior Salesforce Developer for Greengage (Previously known as Silver Lined Solutions before Greengage acquired us) whereby I am the lead developer for two individual Salesforce orgs alongside a team of 3 other developers who I work with and mentor on a day-to-day basis.

I initially joined as a Junior developer back in the start of 2020 working as a Salesforce Consultant, which meant speaking with clients and fulfilling their requests for their Salesforce org (ranging from everything simple like creating fields and validation rules to more complex things like bespoke LWCs and automations)

After just 6 months I was offered the opportunity to be the lead developer for DAG (who is now known as Greengage) to build the foundations for their Salesforce org which is what I've done for the past three and a half years - constructing everything from a deal instalment system, to a bespoke onboarding process, and integrations with tools like GBG, ComplyAdvantage, Wix and BVD - with smaller projects arising here and there for other clients of ours over the years.

The types of projects that I have worked on can be found on my Professional Projects page which you can find [here](/#/professional-projects)
