During this project, I led the development of an onboarding portal for Greengage hosted at [portal.greengage.co](https://portal.greengage.co), this was built as a Salesforce community and used the Salesforce technology stack including Apex and Lightning Web Components. I collaborated with 2 other junior developers plus a senior backend developer in order to build a portal that was capable of doing the following:

- Capture complex company hierarchical structures (Shareholders of Shareholders etc)
- Capture entity information (e.g the Applicants name, company, date of birth, tax identifier etc)
- Support for uploading documents
- Integration with Microsoft Entra Id (Microsoft AD)

This also connected directly to our back office systems which were also extended to support:

- Ability to prompt for futher documentation (e.g Compliance team wants to ask for an additional document upload)
- Ability to feedback application progress to the onboarding portal (e.g application submitted, accepted, rejected etc)

Throughout the project, I maintained open and productive communication with the Product Owner and Project Manager. Timelines, estimations, and internal feedback were regularly discussed to ensure alignment with project goals and internal expectations.

As part of this project, I also setup full source control for this Salesforce environment, creating DevOps pipelines that tested inbound Pull Requests, automatic deployments to the testing environment upon the merge of the Pull Request, and a manual artefact build pipeline for deployments to further environments.
